Section: libdevel
Depends: ${misc:Depends},
         libpwquality1 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Password quality checking and generation (development files)
 libpwquality's purpose is to provide common functions for password
 quality checking and also scoring them based on their apparent randomness. The
 library also provides a function for generating random passwords with good
 pronounceability.
 .
 This package contains the development files, and should be used for
 compilation.
